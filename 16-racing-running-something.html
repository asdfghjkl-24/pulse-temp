    <br>
    <p>I wish I were in grade school, and I wish you were my classmate.</p>
    <p>Outrunning streams over mossy stones designed for slipping.</p>
    <p>Your toes in light-up shoes, LED beacons of my BFF,</p>
    <p>Or bare, gripping pressurised sands and releasing them to the wind's verdict.</p>
    <p>Whether uniformed or casual, we would be of stomping age,</p>
    <p>And our garb would not yet mean a thing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In the evenings, when the streetlights would call us for dinner,</p>
    <p>We'd go home, so as not to worry our mothers or inconvenience our fathers.</p>
    <p>Or perhaps we'd play a card game,</p>
    <p>Get so lost in dealth tangents and forget whose turn it was.</p>
    <p>You'd teach me helpful tricks and look away from my exposed hands--no fear of the</p>
    <p>opponent.</p>
    <p>We'd wish for Jenga towers to tumble just so we could get to the part where we built</p>
    <p>moated castles on the carpet.</p>
    <p>Neighbouring princesses, you'd say,</p>
    <p>And we'd vow to rule this matriarchy in harmony</p>
    <br>
    <p>I wish I could be next to you on New Year's Eve without feeling the need to be picked up</p>
    <p>in my mom's van.</p>
    <p>I wish you felt like a congregation done right or the girls' bathroom at a loud club.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I wish I were in grade school with you because sometimes, you make me feel like glitter</p>
    <p>glue and crayons, and like I'd be such a good mother.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But most of the time, well, it doesn't matter.</p>
    <p>We both need to start looking on the bright side.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What I really wish is to have met when we were in grade school.</p>
    <p>I like the thought of running or racing or something.</p>
    <p>I wanna look over and see your first draft baby tooth gap smile grinning back at me,</p>
    <p>Before we cared so much about winning,</p>
    <p>Before summers made these bodies compete.</p>
    <br>
