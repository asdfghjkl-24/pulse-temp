        <p>The notion of my maternal grandmother conjures two memories-- dropping rice inbetween her floral couch cushions, and one tranquil sleep in her lap. When it aches to remember being such a guest that my spills were deemed adorable, I soothe myself with the fragrances of her home. The secret ingredient is almost always cloves, and a woman is born with all her eggs. When I think of it this way, my grandmother has carried and fed me plenty. Last night, while cooking a meal for my mother and I, I was struck with the thought of my cooking someday becoming <i>mom's cooking.</i> It's a fear. A prophecy. A legacy. A recipe. A sort of imposter syndrome that aches monthly and won't be soothed 'til it becomes my evening routine. But I think one day my daughter will feed me and smile. It'll make her feel one meal closer to security when I lick my lips and say <i>shukran ya shatoura!</i> And then maybe, just maybe, her daughter will write a poem about visiting my house on Sunday mornings. She'll have memories of my critical eye while she tidies her spills. She'll hate some of the meals I make, but love some of them too. She'll fall asleep in my lap, and I'll kiss her forehead without strangers' lips. She'll remember how often I carried and fed her without the need for technicality.</p>
