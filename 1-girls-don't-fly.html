        <p>
            I put on two different shoes, believing they will let me walk to different places <br>
            A high heel unstable to a ballet flat, they fear us growing up <br>
            “Stay young,” they say <br>
            So, I drink down dirt in droves and decide that I deserve decimals of what men have <br>
            <i>A man told me that </i><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The sky is not made for me to find <br>
            Clipped wings prevent vast goals and save me from cloud’s bitter rejection <br>
            “Girls don’t fly,” they say <br>
            So, I wobble along waterfronts, worn out walks work best for weakness <br>
            <I>A man told me that </I><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I stand grounded in a forest, eyes up to where I’m not permitted <br>
            Taste blood after smelling flowers <br>
            “Be skinny,” they say <br>
            So, I dine like a dolly, destroy my insides and dress as Barbie did <br>
            <I>A man told me that </I><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Covered in forest dirt, crawl with swollen ankles <br>
            Everything they asked has broken my bones <br>
            “Why are you dirty?” they ask <br>
            So, I sink into soggy soil, sob into my shredded shirt <br>
            <i>I just did what you told me </i><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Inside my chest is a gold string <br>
            I rip off my mismatched shoes and hug the dirt with my toes <br>
            “But that’s not–” <br>
            <i>I will never believe you again </i><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I sit until my ankles heal, to bear who I am <br>
            The gold string embraces each extremity <br>
            “But girls aren’t supposed to–” <br>
            <i>I will never believe you again </i><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I walk slow on new supports: earth makes meaningful love to each step <br>
            The gold string embraces and reverses the clip of my wings <br>
            You offer me silence because <br>
            <i>I will never believe you again </i><br>
        </p>

        <p> 
            I look to the welcome sign in the clouds <br>
            Truth helps me on a running start to leap to the sky saying yes <br>
            “Don’t fly,” they call from the ground, “men can see under your dress.” <br>
            <i>A man tells me nothing anymore </i><br>
        </p>
    </p>
