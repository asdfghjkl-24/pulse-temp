        I am a guest.
      </p>  
      <p>
        this is not the guest room.
      </p> 
      <p>
            I came home to you an ocean away.
        </p>
        <p>
            I crawled into your bed
        </p>
        <p>
            and felt miniscule.
        </p>
        <p>
            a woman unfolds
        </p>
        <p>
            to cover every surface here,
        </p>
        <p>
            a woman I barely know.
        </p>
        <p>
            there are no faces
        </p>
        <p>
            in the paintings
        </p>
        <p>
        on the walls.
        </p>
      <p>
            this was my room once.
      </p>
      <p>
            the walls are still
      </p>
      <p>
        the same colourâ€”
        </p>
      <p>
        upset stomach pink.
        </p>
      <p>
        I didn't ask if I could be this small
        </p>
      <p>
        or be wrapped up
        </p>
      <p>
        or be here, at this exact latitude, 
        </p>
      <p>
        in this longing for
        </p>
      <p>
        a woman I barely know.
        </p>
      <p>
        I could have called.
        </p>
      <p>
        I could have asked.

        I have been making lists
        </p>
      <p>
        these past few days,
        </p>
      <p>
        lists of things
        </p>
      <p>
        that could replace a name.

        like a guest

      <p>
        in the world

      <p>
        and in my body.

            I have been close to the surface lately,

      <p>
        blue creeks rushing through soft summer
        </p>
      <p>
        still, still.

        <p>
        I am trying hard

        <p>
        not to let myself dry out
        </p>
        <p>
        so I don't get my blood

        <p>
        they are facing away.

        <p>
        they are all waiting,

        <p>
        still and waiting,

        <p>
        still waiting.
