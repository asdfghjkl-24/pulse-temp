        <p>
            Dawn shows her face on the cigarette house, tar doors and burnt furniture <br>
            I start my morning with tears that gave up their race down my cheek <br>
            <i>Nobody won </i><br>
            Covers flick off the ash, even the inanimate can’t stand what they have no feelings for <br>
            I stand up and become my bedding <br>
            The taste of wheezing so familiar <br>
            No matter what I serve on the tobacco table, I have no tongue left for anything else <br>
            Seated in my designated chair, the smoke comes to play <br>
            My eyes and feet aflame yet again <br>
            <i>There is no door, there is no door </i><br>
            Arms out, I try <br>
            Clawing through polluted air with gnawed nails and promise <br>
            Breathe it in, you’ll never breathe it again <br>
            <i>I know and that is the point </i><br>
            My lips yearned for tobacco’s end, the only kiss that didn’t lie to me <br>
            But I now hold my flowers to my chest and let lungs do what they’re supposed to do <br>
            This body will learn to stop craving the tar of deceit <br>
