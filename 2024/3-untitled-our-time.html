    <br>
    <p>I have this dream</p>
    <p>where I'm brought into a huge tiled fridge</p>
    <p>seafoam green and silver</p>
    <p>with the heaviest door I've ever pressed against</p>
    <p>to identify a body</p>
    <p>doctor rolls out the drawer smooth as a ballpoint pen</p>
    <p>and there is a man's body sapped and dull in front of me</p>
    <p>I don't know him from adam</p>
    <p>but I weep cold tears</p>
    <p>until I wake up</p>
    <p>I don't know what killed him</p>
    <p>but there is something</p>
    <p>in the fluttering paper of his face that tells me</p>
    <p>we have tasted the same blood</p>
    <br>
    <p>when I have nightmares</p>
    <p>I like to go back to sleep</p>
    <p>to wash them from my mouth</p>
    <p>I used to think that bears</p>
    <p>slept all through hibernation without waking</p>
    <p>and got jealous</p>
    <p>sometimes moving forward</p>
    <p>is an effort worthy to make sisyphus sigh</p>
    <p>and I am never a hero or even a gentleman about it</p>
    <br>
    <p>when I stand on everyone else's ceiling</p>
    <p>and think about how many bodies are floating below</p>
    <p>I want to make the city say something to me</p>
    <p>I want to get far back enough to find its face and have it say</p>
    <p>"there is nowhere too far gone that love cannot reach you"</p>
    <p>I have to believe</p>
    <p>there is nowhere so bleached barren or buried</p>
    <p>no sanctuary or sanitorium so isolated</p>
    <p>that love cannot walk to you if you're patient</p>
    <p>no pen or sword, barbed wire or grave</p>
    <p>that love cannot claw its way out if there are hands willing enough</p>
    <p>and as the ocean rises we will teach it to swim</p>
    <p>I have to believe</p>
    <p>in grottos and parks</p>
    <p>in gazebos and gardens</p>
    <p>in alleys and in the dark</p>
    <p>I have to believe</p>
    <p>in heavens on earth</p>
    <p>that can be made through clothes and quickly dismantled before anyone sees</p>
    <p>I have to grab at this rope and tie it to something before it goes taut</p>
    <p>and pray that it holds</p>
    <br>
    <p>I want to stain my hands with the salt unspilled</p>
    <p>all those thousands of years</p>
    <p>every syllable screaming in a bit-tie tourniquet</p>
    <p>"we will have this now, this taste</p>
    <p>drunk from our cupped palms</p>
    <p>we will rip it flesh and blood from the hidden places</p>
    <p>as our last movements</p>
    <p>we will make something so beautiful it hurts to look at</p>
    <p>and hush it sweetly when we kill it over and over</p>
    <p>we will pass by on the street with each other in our spit and no second glance</p>
    <p>we will have each other</p>
    <p>and someday so will they</p>
    <p>and hopefully a bit more room to breathe"</p>
    <br>
    <p>I breathe</p>
    <p>I breathe in flaked copper from bodies rusted together in tombs</p>
    <p>hands fused like book pages returning to pulp</p>
    <p>hands that used to comb each other's hair and cup each other's cheeks</p>
    <p>the ambrosia still held in their clenched teeth like ancient honey</p>
    <p>I breathe in the distance between oceans</p>
    <p>the spaces between bookshelves and school desks and bunk beds</p>
    <p>and between best friends</p>
    <p>and maybe if I do it deep enough I can fold time down like a vacuum to bellows</p>
    <p>like a bone folder to paper</p>
    <p>like a flipbook</p>
    <p>and I can dance with them all at once</p>
    <p>all the sweet-tooths, all the bodies</p>
    <p>with names buried like dog tags in the roofs of their mouths</p>
    <p>we can cough up the dust and lost wax together</p>
    <p>hold back each other's hair</p>
    <p>we can identify each other in those silver drawers</p>
    <p>and weep as strangers</p>
    <p>that have tasted the same bloodâ€”</p>
    <br>
    <p>I breathe, I breathe, I breathe for all of us.</p>
